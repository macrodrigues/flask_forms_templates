# Online Forms Bundle
This is a bundle of different online forms.

This allows me to use each form on the same container when deploying.

Since I don't launch two surveys/forms at the same time I can use Zeet to deploy, one or another, without creating a new project.

If you want to know more about Zeet, check my medium article:

This repository is always in construction, since I will be adding forms/surveys depending on the need.

The stack I used to build the forms is: Flask, Flask-WTF, HTML and CSS.

To know more about how to build an online survey using this stack, checkout my medium post:
